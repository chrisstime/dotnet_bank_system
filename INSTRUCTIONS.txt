Please run the .exe file in the dotnet_bank_system/bank_system/bin/Debug folder after code has been compiled at least once
or via visual studio (by clicking on Start button).

Note:
There are sleep times throughout the program to allow the user ample time to read the messaging in the program, 
please allow at least one second for the program to move to the next stage after a message is shown.
The program also assumes balance, deposit and withdrawal will be in whole numbers (the exact nature was not specified in the assignment specifications).
